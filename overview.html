    <h1>Overview <small>Data-Intensive Computing with MapReduce (Spring 2013)</small></h1>
  </div>

<h3>About the Course</h3>

<p>Our world is being revolutionized by "big data": petabyte-scale
data stores are popping up everywhere, opening up exciting
opportunities for computing applications and scientific
discovery. Data-intensive computing requires programming models that
allow us to easily distribute computations across large clusters, and
this is where MapReduce comes in. MapReduce, especially the Hadoop
open-source implementation, has recently emerged as a popular
framework for data-intensive computing. Among its advantages include
the ability to horizontally scale to petabytes of data on thousands of
commodity servers, easy-to-understand programming semantics, and a
high degree of fault tolerance. Hadoop lies at the core of an
application stack that is gaining widespread adoption in both industry
and academia.</p>

<p>This course will provide an introduction to Hadoop, focusing
specifically on algorithm design and "thinking at scale", applied to a
variety of domains: text, graphs, relational data, etc. We will also
cover other components in the Hadoop ecosystem and alternative
programming models.</p>

<p><b>Course Credit in Computer Science:</b> For graduate students in
the Computer Science Department, this course has been approved as a
Ph.D. qualifying course in DB, an MS qualifying course in DB, and an
MS Comp in DB.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>If you're interested in my research, here is
<a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/">my homepage</a>. The
best way to get in touch with me is via email, at jimmylin@umd.edu. I
am available by appointment to discuss material from class, the
readings, homework assignments, the project, etc.  Email is the best
way to reach me to set up an appointment, and it's also a good way to
get a quick answer to a simple question.</p>

<h3>Course Materials</h3>

<p>The most recent version of all materials for the course will be
posted on this website, including the syllabus, readings, slides used
in class, and homework assignments. Please check the site frequently
for updates.</p>

<p>The principal textbooks for this course are:</p>

<p>Readings from other sources will be assigned as appropriate.</p>

<p>University of Maryland students have free access to the second book
via Safari Books Online (click the "Online version" links above), but
you may wish to purchase paper copies for convenience. Any online
bookseller will have these books.</p>

<p>You're encouraged to use the course mailing list to share
information that would be of general interest or for any other purpose
that seems reasonable. Mail sent to that address will reach me and all
students. If you have not received a message from the mailing list
yet, please contact me to make sure that your correct address is
included.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>The homework assignments are designed to provide an opportunity for
you to explore specific topics in a structured way. You may work
together on the homework assignments, but all of the material that is
turned in for grading must be produced individually. For example, you
may form study groups and work out homework solutions together on a
whiteboard or by each working separately on different computers and
then sharing what you've learned, but it would not be permissible for
someone to prepare an answer set and then for others to copy those
answers and submit it as their own work. Turning in copied files is
specifically prohibited; you <b>must</b> individually write (type) any
material that is submitted for grading, including code.</p>

<p>Assignments are due before the class indicated on
the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.</p>

<p><i>Late policy:</i> For assignments turned in 24 hours late (or
less), I will take the grade you would have gotten and multiply it by
0.75; For assignments turned in more than 24 hours late but less than
48 hours late, I will take the grade you have gotten and multiply it
by 0.5, and so on.</p>

<p>The course will include a final group project. More details can be
found at <a href="assignments.html#finalproject">here</a>. In
addition, there will be a midterm and a final exam for the course.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally recognized
Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student Honor
Council. This Code sets standards for academic integrity at Maryland
for all undergraduate and graduate students. As a student you are
responsible for upholding these standards for this course. It is very
important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the
Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
<a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu">this site</a>.</p>


<h3>Class Attendance</h3>

<p>This is a graduate course in which <i>you</i> are responsible for
making your own decisions regarding how best to master the material.
You will be held accountable for all content covered in class, in the
assigned readings, and in assignments. Experience strongly suggests
that you should attend classes. Class attendance for the midterm,
final, and final project presentations (May 2 and May 9) is
required.</p>

<b>Accommodations for Religious Holidays and Other Special
Circumstances.</b> Students wishing to discuss accommodations for
religious holidays on dates that assignments are due, or other
circumstances not addressed in this course information page, should
discuss those circumstances with me <u>before</u> the third class
session in order to permit adequate time for planning. Only
accommodations for unforeseeable circumstances will be considered
after that date.</p>

<b>Accommodations for Disabilities.</b> The University is legally
obligated to provide appropriate accommodations for students with
documented disabilities.  Accommodations will be made only in
accordance with University policy.  Students who are entitled to
accommodations due to disabilities must first set up an appointment
with the <a href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/DSS/">Disability
Support Services (DSS)</a>. To permit adequate planning, this process
must be completed and I must be notified by DSS at least two weeks
before the session in which the accommodation is required.</p>
